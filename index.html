      <br>
      <p>In 2020, with nothing left but a roll of duct tape and a dog named Cogswell, Tim Green set out to save the world from any more unnecessary jazz clubs. After researching this by visiting as many jazz clubs as he could in one year, and counting the
        number of them that were still in business at the end of that year (there were none that were still in business), Green compiled all of his data using Python (and duct tape) and began learning to develop in Swift and Xcode so that he could provide
        an iOS app to better advise people on whether or not they should open a jazz club. (To save you the trouble of downloading the app, the answer is no, you should not open a jazz club.)</p></td>
